Project 4 Description / Proposal

# Summarized description: 
For project 4, I anticipate to create three different illustrations of various objects. I want to make an abstract piece to include in my portfolio which I am currently working on. I want to ultimately do some cool things with JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS to make the experience interactive and artistic.

# What I need to learn: 
In order to achieve this, I will need to learn JavaScript and jQuery more in depth and I will be watching many tutorials, especially tutorials that implement simple shapes and make them interactive and show them in motion. I will make the illustrations visually appealing. I will basically be learning how to do “creative coding”.

These tutorials might be helpful:
